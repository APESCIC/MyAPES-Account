# Product terminology glossary

Single source for **UI wording** in MyAPES Account. Architecture layer names stay in [architecture.md](architecture.md) and [ADR 0001](adr/0001-core-modules-plugins.md); keep the same words in both places.

Locale and key conventions: [localisation.md](localisation.md). Canonical labels live in `lang/en_GB/terms.php`. Deprecated synonyms for CI lint ([#276](https://github.com/APESCIC/MyAPES-Account/issues/276)) live in `config/glossary.php`.

**Rules**

- Display labels only — do not rename stored permission strings or live URLs for wording.
- Prefer `__('terms.*')` / `trans_choice('terms.*', $n)` once extraction waves wire screens.
- Bambie’s approval of the Language milestone plan is glossary sign-off for Wave 0b.

## Product and layers

| Canonical | Meaning / audience | Use in UI | Avoid | Lang key |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MyAPES Account | This application — user-facing product name (chrome, emails, page titles, public notices). | Brand, titles, emails, footer when referring to the product people use. | MyAPES Core (in public/user-facing chrome); “the Core app” as a display name. | `terms.app_name` |
| MyAPES Core | Platform / internal naming (repo history, some deploy notes, Change Log Hub provenance). Not the public product label. | Docs and internal notes only when distinguishing platform from product. Prefer “MyAPES Account” on screen. | Using Core as the default `<title>`, OG site name, or welcome headline. | `terms.platform_name` |
| Core | Always-on platform layer (auth, accounts, profiles, access, Admin shell, …). | Rarely as a standalone nav label; say Admin, Access, etc. for screens. | Calling an organisation area or plugin “Core”. | `terms.core` |
| Module | Organisation area package (`modules/<slug>`). | Admin → **Modules** (enable areas). Area hubs use the area’s public name. | sub-core; service area / Service (when it means the area); calling a feature a module in UI. | `terms.module` / `terms.modules` |
| Plugin | Reusable feature package (`plugins/<slug>`), enabled per module. | Admin → **Plugins**; empty states (“Plugins will appear here…”). | module / module type (when it means a feature); “add-on” as the primary label. | `terms.plugin` / `terms.plugins` |
| Plugin enablement | One module with one plugin switched on (e.g. `apes-cic:recruitment`). | Settings and enablement copy: “enabled for this module”. | module instance (in UI). | `terms.plugin_enablement` |
| Plugin settings | Per-enablement settings edited from Admin → Plugins. | **Settings** link / **Plugin settings** page titles. | module settings (in UI). | `terms.plugin_settings` |
| Admin | Unified staff administration shell after v0.35. | Primary nav **Admin**; page titles under `/admin`. | Super Admin as a nav door or page-family label. | `terms.admin` |
| Super Admin | Access tier / permission (`superadmin.access`) and protected role — not a separate shell. | Permission and role catalogue wording only when describing that tier. | Super Admin as primary nav or as the name of the Admin area. | `terms.super_admin` |

## Account types

| Canonical | Meaning / audience | Use in UI | Avoid | Lang key |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| Access group | Managed Cloudron / directory group for authorisation. | Access → **Groups**. | Calling groups “roles”. | `terms.access_group` / `terms.access_groups` |

## Machine-readable deprecated synonyms

`config/glossary.php` → `deprecated_synonyms` lists patterns CI ([#276](https://github.com/APESCIC/MyAPES-Account/issues/276)) may grep in Blade and lang values. Each entry has `canonical`, optional `contexts` (`nav`, `public_ui`, `admin_ui`), and `notes`. Do not treat permission strings or live URLs as violations.
